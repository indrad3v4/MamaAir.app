We may collect personal information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses) that you affirmatively give to us, such as when you complete the contact form or contact us by email. Giving us personal information through the Website is voluntary and is not required to use the Website.

As you navigate through and interact with the Website, certain data may be collected through automatic data collection technologies that collect statistical (non-personal) information about your equipment, browsing actions, and Website usage patterns. This data includes information about content accessed and page load times, internet connection, IP address, and geographic location by country. The data we collect through these automated technologies is used to help us improve the Website and provide a more personalized experience. The information we collect automatically is only statistical data and does not include personal information.

The technologies used for this automatic data collection may include, but are not limited to:
• Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate settings on your browser.

Do Not Track Disclosure
Some web browsers may transmit do not track (“DNT”) signals to websites with which the user communicates. To date, there is no industry standard for DNT, and users cannot know how a given company responds to a DNT signal they receive from browsers. ‘Mama Air’ is committed to remaining apprised of DNT standards. However, we do not support DNT browser settings and do not currently participate in any DNT frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals or other mechanisms regarding the collection of your personal information.
