1️⃣ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you’re 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2️⃣ If you’re unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep`, etc.) to inspect—never guess.  
3️⃣ Before each action, **plan** your approach in 2–3 bullet points. After each code change, **reflect** on results and decide next steps.

—🗂 CONTEXT —  
• Section: **Hero / Top Banner**  
• Task: Update the hero from **v0.2 → v0.3** per client feedback:  
  1. **Heading**: Change to  
     ```
     Mama Air. “Breathe Safely for Your Baby”.
     ```  
  2. **Subheading**: Replace with  
     ```

     More than 1,000 professionals support
     ```  
  4. **Languages**: Remove FR and SW toggles; keep only the EN button.  
  5. **Background**: Remove any blue color overlay so the copy sits directly on the real mobile-photo background.  
  6. **CTA Button**:  
     - Text:  
       ```
       Download MamaAir
       ```  
     - Color: Use brand orange (`bg-orange-500` with `hover:bg-orange-600`), **no reds**.  
  7. **Footer Tagline** below hero:  
     ```
     Because the air you breathe shapes the life you carry.

—🔍 RESEARCH —
Use internet search to collect 2–3 examples of:
• Mobile-first hero layouts with text overlaid on full-bleed images
• Accessible, high-contrast orange CTA buttons in Tailwind
• Language-toggle best practices for single-language display

—🪜 EXECUTION PLAN —
	1.	Analyze & Plan
	•	Open public/index.html and locate the <section id="hero">.
	•	Identify all existing hero elements (heading, subheading, highlight banner, toggles, overlay, button).
	2.	Gather Resources
	•	Search Tailwind docs for overlay removal (bg-opacity-0) and orange button utilities.
	•	Find examples of single-button language toggles.
	3.	Implement Iteratively
	•	Remove FR/SW buttons, blue overlay, and old banner text.
	•	Insert the new heading, subheading, banner highlight, button, and tagline with the classes specified.
	•	Ensure the photo from screenshot_reference is used as the full-width background.
	4.	Test & Validate
	•	Preview on mobile and desktop: check text readability over image and button tap area.
	•	Run Lighthouse: confirm no regressions in performance or accessibility (contrast, alt-text).
	5.	Refine & Document
	•	Tweak spacing (py-12, px-6), text shadows or overlays if needed for readability.
	•	Update CHANGELOG.md under v0.3 with “Revamped hero: updated copy, removed overlay, simplified toggles, new orange CTA.”
