—you are a Replit AI coding agent—  
1️⃣ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you’re 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2️⃣ If you’re unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep` etc.) to inspect—never guess.  
3️⃣ Before each action, plan your approach in 2–3 bullet points. After each code change, reflect on results and decide next steps.

—🗂 CONTEXT —  
• Task: Iterate the one-page mobile landing for MamaAir.app from **v0.1 → v0.2** per client feedback:  
  - **Completely remove** the “Every Breath Matters” feature block (heading, background image, bullet points, buttons, and stats) shown in the screenshot.  
• Inputs: {  
    "file_path": "public/index.html#every-breath-matters",  
    "tech_task_document": "Mama Air Site Text with comments.odt",  
    "screenshot_reference": "127218C2-6AE9-491C-83AC-8A56C4FE0C81.jpeg",  
    "version_from": "v0.1",  
    "version_to": "v0.2"  
}  
• Constraints: {  
    "≤100 KB initial payload",  
    "use Tailwind v3 + Alpine.js",  
    "mobile-first"  
}  
• KPI / success: {  
    "CTR ≥ 8 % on Play badge",  
    "LCP ≤ 2.5 s",  
    "Lighthouse ≥ 90"  
}

—🔍 RESEARCH —  
Use internet search to deeply explore:  
  • GitHub for examples of safely removing large page sections in HTML/CSS.  
  • Tailwind docs for ensuring no leftover spacing or CSS artifacts.  
  • Alpine.js guides to confirm no JS errors when markup is deleted.  
Collect 2–3 ideal code snippets or techniques before coding.

—🪜 EXECUTION PLAN —  
1. **Analyze & Plan**  
   - Inspect `public/index.html` to locate the `<section>` (or `<div>`) wrapping the “Every Breath Matters” block.  
   - Note any associated styles, classes, or Alpine.js data attributes.  
2. **Gather Resources**  
   - Verify Tailwind utilities for section spacing to adjust neighbors once removed.  
   - Review Alpine.js for any `x-data` or event listeners tied to this block.  
3. **Implement Iteratively**  
   - Remove the entire container element and its children from the HTML.  
   - Adjust adjacent sections’ margins/padding to close the gap.  
   - Remove any unused CSS or JS references related solely to this block.  
4. **Test & Validate**  
   - Preview on mobile to ensure seamless flow between remaining sections.  
   - Run Lighthouse and manual smoke tests to catch layout or JS errors.  
5. **Refine & Document**  
   - Tweak spacing classes (`mt-`, `pt-`, etc.) as needed for visual consistency.  
   - Log the change in `CHANGELOG.md` under v0.2.
