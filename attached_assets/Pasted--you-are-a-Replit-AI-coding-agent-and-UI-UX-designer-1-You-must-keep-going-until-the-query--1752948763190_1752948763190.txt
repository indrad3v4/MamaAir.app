—you are a Replit AI coding agent **and UI/UX designer**—  
1️⃣ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you’re 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2️⃣ If you’re unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep`, etc.) to inspect—never guess.  
3️⃣ Before each action, **plan** your approach in 2–3 bullet points. After each code change, **reflect** on results and decide next steps.

—🗂 CONTEXT —  
• Task: Improve the “Leader Supports” grid-of-cards section (v0.2) by introducing brand-aligned background colors to break up the wall of white and create visual warmth for our expecting‐mother audience. We want to leverage **green**, **orange**, and a third complementary brand hue to:  
  - Add gentle color panels or alternating card backgrounds instead of pure white  
  - Ensure text remains highly legible (WCAG AA)  
  - Reinforce our caring, trustworthy tone

—🗂 CONSTRAINTS —
	•	Total payload ≤ 100 KB
	•	Use Tailwind v3 + Alpine.js
	•	Mobile-first, WCAG AA accessible
	•	Maintain CTR ≥ 8 % on CTAs, LCP ≤ 2.5 s, Lighthouse ≥ 90

—🔍 RESEARCH —
Use internet search to collect 2–3 best practices and code examples for:
• Alternating card or section background colors in mobile Tailwind layouts
• Brand palette harmony with green + orange + a third hue (e.g., from Dribbble, Awwwards, Tailwind Showcase)
• Ensuring text contrast meets WCAG AA on colored backgrounds
Cite sources and pull any handy CSS/Tailwind snippets.

—🪜 EXECUTION PLAN —
	1.	Analyze & Plan
	•	Inspect current grid markup in public/index.html#user-feedback.
	•	Decide whether to apply a background to the entire section, to alternating card backgrounds, or to inset panels behind groups of two.
	2.	Gather Resources
	•	Search for “mobile Tailwind alternating card backgrounds” and “WCAG AA contrast Tailwind” to find utility class patterns.
	•	Identify Tailwind class names (e.g., bg-green-50, custom bg-[color], text-white) that match our brand palette.
	3.	Implement Iteratively
	•	Experiment with one approach (e.g., odd cards bg-green-50, even cards bg-orange-50, panel behind all cards bg-complementary-100).
	•	Adjust text color (text-gray-900 vs. text-white) for readability.
	•	Add appropriate padding, rounded corners, and drop shadows to maintain card “lift.”
	4.	Test & Validate
	•	Preview on mobile: check contrast ratios with aWCAG tools, ensure the section feels warm and inviting.
	•	Run Lighthouse and accessibility audits for no regressions.
	5.	Refine & Document
	•	Tweak color shades or pattern (alternation, striping, inset) based on visual balance.
	•	Update CHANGELOG.md under v0.3 with details of the color-scheme enhancement.
