—you are a Replit AI coding agent **and UI/UX designer**—  
1️⃣ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you’re 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2️⃣ If you’re unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep`, etc.) to inspect—never guess.  
3️⃣ Before each action, **plan** your approach in 2–3 bullet points. After each code change, **reflect** on results and decide next steps.

—🗂 CONTEXT —  
• Section: **Mobile Preview** (the framed phone mockup under the hero)  
• Task (v0.2 → v0.3): Replace the current placeholder device-frame illustration with the actual mobile screenshot provided. Keep the same “device frame” container, badge position, and overall layout—just swap out the image asset.  

—🗂 INPUTS —  
```json
{
  "file_path": "public/index.html#mobile-preview",
  "screenshot_reference": "05B16018-F7DF-4EF2-96B5-0BECDAE00469.jpeg",
  "version_from": "v0.2",
  "version_to": "v0.3"
}

—🗂 CONSTRAINTS —
	•	Payload ≤ 100 KB
	•	Tech: Tailwind v3 + Alpine.js
	•	Mobile-first, WCAG AA accessible
	•	Maintain existing KPI targets (CTR ≥ 8 %, LCP ≤ 2.5 s, Lighthouse ≥ 90)

—🔍 RESEARCH —
Use internet search to collect 2–3 examples of:
• Tailwind patterns for device-frame wrappers (relative, overflow-hidden, rounded-3xl, shadow-lg)
• Proper CSS for background image positioning within a mockup frame
• Ensuring image aspect ratio is preserved (object-cover, w-full, h-auto)

—🪜 EXECUTION PLAN —
	1.	Analyze & Plan
	•	Open public/index.html and locate the <section id="mobile-preview"> (or equivalent).
	•	Identify the <img> or <div> currently sourcing the placeholder mockup asset.
	2.	Gather Resources
	•	Confirm Tailwind utilities for maintaining the frame container styles (e.g., relative, p-4, bg-transparent, rounded-3xl, shadow-xl).
	•	Find best-practice utilities for responsive object-cover behavior.
	3.	Implement Iteratively
	•	Replace the src (or background-image) of the device-frame <img>/<div> with "05B16018-F7DF-4EF2-96B5-0BECDAE00469.jpeg".
	•	Ensure alt="Screenshot of Mama Air mobile UI" is present for accessibility.
	•	Verify the badge element (More than 1,000 professionals support) remains at the correct absolute position relative to the frame.
	4.	Test & Validate
	•	Preview in mobile and desktop breakpoints: confirm the new screenshot fills the frame exactly, without distortion or cropping.
	•	Run Lighthouse and an a11y audit to ensure contrast and loading performance aren’t impacted.
	5.	Refine & Document
	•	Tweak container padding or object-position if the UI chrome appears off-center.
	•	Update CHANGELOG.md under v0.3: “Swapped placeholder mockup for real mobile UI screenshot in Mobile Preview section.”
