At the end of the applicable Retention Period, we will remove your Personal Data from our databases and will require that our Business Partners remove any identifiable Personal Data from their databases. If there is any data that we are unable to delete entirely from our systems for technical reasons, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing of such data. Please note that once we disclose your Personal Data to third parties, we may not be able to access that Personal Data and we cannot force the deletion or modification of such information by third parties.

De-Identified Data: ‘Mama Air’ and its Business Partners reserve the right to continue using deidentified data indefinitely, even after Personal Data has been removed from ‘Mama Air’’s databases. We may continue to disclose de-identified data to third parties in a manner that does not reveal personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy. Our continued use of de-identified data will comport with applicable law.  

Personal Data from Minors
‘Mama Air’ does not knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18. Additionally, our Platform and Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 18 at this time.

You further understand that it may not be technologically possible to remove all of your Personal Data from our systems.

‘Mama Air’ understands the importance of data confidentiality and security. We use a combination of reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security controls to: (i) maintain the security and integrity of your Personal Data; (ii) protect against any threats or hazards to the security or integrity of your Personal Data; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information in our possession or control that could result in substantial harm to you.

—🔍 RESEARCH —  
Use internet search to deeply explore:  
  • GitHub for lightweight accordion components using Tailwind + Alpine.js.  
  • Medium/HackerNoon for best practices on accessible accordions.  
  • Official Tailwind docs for customizing SVG/icon colors.  
Collect 2–3 ideal code snippets before coding.

—🪜 EXECUTION PLAN —  
1. **Analyze & Plan**  
   - Inspect existing HTML for the policies section in `public/index.html`.  
   - Identify SVG/icon elements and policy list markup.  
2. **Gather Resources**  
   - Look up Tailwind utilities for applying the exact green fill to icons.  
   - Find an Alpine.js accordion pattern supporting multiple independent panels.  
3. **Implement Iteratively**  
   - Update each icon’s classes (e.g. `fill-current text-green-500` or custom green).  
   - Wrap each policy in an Alpine-controlled `<div>` with `x-data`, `x-show` for panel toggling.  
   - Insert placeholder bindings for `policy_contents[...]` into the expanded panel.  
4. **Test & Validate**  
   - Preview on mobile viewport to ensure icons render green and panels expand/collapse.  
   - Run Lighthouse to confirm no performance regressions.  
5. **Refine & Document**  
   - Adjust spacing or transitions if needed.  
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with v0.2 notes and comment code changes.
