Here are targeted questions—section by section—to spot UI discrepancies and text mismatches between this prototype and our Tech Task. Use these to refine your prompt for adapting the HTML:

---

## Header / Navbar

1. The live header still uses “MyApp” and a purple gradient—should this be replaced with the “Mama Air” word-mark and our navy-amber palette?
2. The language switch shows EN/FR/SW but isn’t styled per spec (light background, slate-800 text)—should we restyle it to match our minimal Tailwind look?

## Hero Section

3. The headline reads “Ваше женское здоровье…” instead of “Breathe Safely for Your Baby.” Should we update both text and `lang="ru"` to English for MVP?
4. The current hero uses a purple-amber gradient—tech spec calls for a deep-navy background with amber moon accents. Do we swap in `hero-night.png` with overlay?
5. The Play badge here is black with white text; spec requires a teal-700 badge with the GA4 snippet. Should we rebuild it as `<a class="bg-teal-700 hover:bg-teal-800">…</a>` and attach analytics?

## Features / “Why”

6. This features grid is generic and shows cycle-tracker icons—should we replace each card’s icon and text with our four core benefits from Mama Air Site Text?
7. The copy currently says “Точный календарь цикла” etc.—needs to become English bullets like “Air pollution alerts tailored to your location.”

## How It Works

8. Prototype uses numbered circles on a gradient background; spec wants Heroicons outlines + white background. Should we switch to three `svg` icons with amber-500 stroke on neutral-50?
9. The footer badge reads “Powered by DIAQNOSTIC analytics” but is missing the link footnote. Should we append `<small><a href="https://diaqnostic.com/">…</a></small>`?

## Download & QR

10. The QR lives in the CTA section, not in its own “Download” block. Should we move it under heading “Download Mama Air” and add the subtext about Sub-Saharan regions?
11. The App Store link is present—tech task is Android-only for MVP. Should we remove the App Store button entirely and only render Google Play plus QR?

## Policies Accordion

12. The current FAQ uses manual JS and FontAwesome. Spec calls for Alpine.js-powered accordion with our four policy texts. Should we replace this section entirely?

## Contact & Footer

13. The live “Contact Us” embeds a missing Google Drive screenshot. Should we remove that iframe and embed the Google Forms iframe from [support@mamaair.app](mailto:support@mamaair.app)?
14. Footer lists “MyApp” social links and mailing list—spec needs only quick links (About / Policies / Contact) and © 2025 Mama Air. Should we simplify accordingly?
