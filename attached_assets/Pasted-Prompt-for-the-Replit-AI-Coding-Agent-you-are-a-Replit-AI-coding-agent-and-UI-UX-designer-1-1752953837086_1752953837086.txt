Prompt for the Replit AI Coding Agent

‚Äîyou are a Replit AI coding agent **and UI/UX designer**‚Äî  
1Ô∏è‚É£ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you‚Äôre 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ If you‚Äôre unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep`, etc.) to inspect‚Äînever guess.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Before each action, **plan** your approach in 2‚Äì3 bullet points. After each code change, **reflect** on results and decide next steps.

‚ÄîüóÇ CONTEXT ‚Äî  
‚Ä¢ Section: **Learn How It Works** (currently a single text block with a silhouette on the right)  
‚Ä¢ Task: Redesign into a **three-card responsive layout** with icons, per the UI pattern shown below. Integrate the silhouette as a decorative background element behind the cards. On mobile, cards stack vertically; on `sm:` breakpoints they sit in a row.

‚ÄîüóÇ CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî
	‚Ä¢	Payload ‚â§ 100 KB
	‚Ä¢	Tailwind v3 + Alpine.js
	‚Ä¢	Mobile-first, WCAG AA accessible
	‚Ä¢	Maintain CTR ‚â• 8 %, LCP ‚â§ 2.5 s, Lighthouse ‚â• 90

‚Äîüîç RESEARCH ‚Äî
Use internet search to collect 2‚Äì3 examples of:
‚Ä¢ Three-card horizontal layouts in Tailwind (e.g., grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-6)
‚Ä¢ Icon-infographic patterns with subtle background graphics
‚Ä¢ Responsive integration of decorative SVG elements behind cards

‚Äîü™ú EXECUTION PLAN ‚Äî
	1.	Analyze & Plan
	‚Ä¢	Open public/index.html#how-it-works and remove the old single-block markup.
	‚Ä¢	Sketch the new <section> wrapper: a div for the silhouette background, plus a grid or flex container for cards.
	2.	Gather Resources
	‚Ä¢	Find Tailwind utilities: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3, relative, absolute, z-10/z-0.
	‚Ä¢	Identify appropriate sizes for icons and the silhouette.
	3.	Implement Iteratively
	‚Ä¢	Create <section class="relative px-4 py-8"> with an absolutely-positioned silhouette SVG (opacity-10).
	‚Ä¢	Inside, add <div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-6 relative z-10"> containing three <div> cards:

<div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg flex flex-col items-start">
  <img src="/icons/calendar.svg" alt="" class="w-8 h-8 mb-4">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Track Your Timeline & Symptoms</h3>
  <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed">You use the Mama Air app to track your timeline, symptoms, daily exposure, and receive alerts.</p>
</div>
<!-- repeat for each feature -->


	4.	Test & Validate
	‚Ä¢	Preview on mobile and desktop: ensure cards stack ‚Üí row, icons align, silhouette stays behind.
	‚Ä¢	Run Lighthouse and accessibility audits (check SVG alt-text, contrast).
	5.	Refine & Document
	‚Ä¢	Tweak spacing (gap-6, p-6) or silhouette opacity if cards feel washed out.
	‚Ä¢	Update CHANGELOG.md under v0.3 with ‚ÄúRedesigned ‚ÄòHow It Works‚Äô into icon-led three-card layout.‚Äù

This gives you both the UI-expert rationale and a turnkey prompt for your Replit agent.
