—you are a Replit AI coding agent **and UI/UX designer**—  
1️⃣ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you’re 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2️⃣ If you’re unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep` etc.) to inspect—never guess.  
3️⃣ Before each action, **plan** your approach in 2–3 bullet points. After each code change, **reflect** on results and decide next steps.

—🗂 CONTEXT —  
• Task: Overhaul the **“User Reviews & Leader Supports”** block on the MamaAir landing (v0.1 → v0.2) per client feedback:  
  1. **Remove** the entire existing “User Reviews” section (heading, subheading, two cards, average rating).  
  2. **Replace** it with a professional endorsements section titled **“Leader Supports”**, with this exact content **word-for-word**:

  **Leader Supports**  
  *Learn how opinion leaders endorse our approach.*

  **Francine Yao Fu (Australia). Master of Public Health | Public Health Researcher | Community Health*  
  “What you are doing is very meaningful to the women's community and empowering women's health. I am very impressed.”

  **Natalie D. Hanson, Ph.D (Chicago, US). Driving innovation & growth in Women's Health*  
  “I think your approach of the intersection of climate issue and femtech is an interesting one!”

  **Barun Aggarwal (Delhi, India). Founder BreatheEasy | WELL AP, RESET AP | Global IAQ Leader*  
  “That’s a great product…much needed in many parts of the world. We should collaborate on helping the to-be moms breathe better air!”

  **Lisa Maria Madera (Pichincha, Ecuador). Mother, Educator, Community weaver. Climate Parent Fellow 2024*  
  “Your work sounds really interesting and important. I am really interested in applying diagnostic environmental tools and how we might leverage that information to create safer environments for our children as we face the challenges of climate change and environmental degradation.”

  **Laura Spence (Sheffield, UK). Midwife. Educator. Advocate. Founder of NeuroNatal*  
  “Your work sounds fascinating and so important. The impact of environmental factors like air pollution on maternal and fetal health is still so under-discussed, yet hugely significant.”

  **Dr. Mories Atoki (Lagos, Nigeria). CEO – ABCHealth | Board Director | Health & Education Advocate*  
  “Personalised environmental risk tracking… what you do sounds amazing!”

  **Sosthenes (Elias) Bagumbe (Dodoma, Tanzania). Gen. Secretary of Pan African Health Informatics Association (HELINA)*  
  “I am actually very interested in your approach.”

  **Phyllis (Muruku) Kiburi (Nairobi, Kenya). Maternal-Child Health | Environmental & Public Health*  
  “It is impressive to see how DIAGNOSTIC translates complex air quality data into personalised health recommendations. I am very impressed with the Mama Air app's focus on supporting African women in real high-risk environments.”

  **Moona Kayawo (Nairobi, Kenya). Digital/Public Health | Mandela Washington Fellow 2024 & Climate Change*  
  “Good to hear how you are utilizing AI and digital health interventions to solve public health challenges.”

—✨ CONSTRAINTS & KPI —
	•	Payload ≤100 KB
	•	Tech: Tailwind v3 + Alpine.js
	•	Mobile-first, WCAG AA
	•	CTR ≥ 8 % on CTA badges
	•	LCP ≤ 2.5 s, Lighthouse ≥ 90

—🔍 RESEARCH —
Use internet search to gather 2–3 examples of:
	•	Professional endorsement listings in mobile Tailwind sites
	•	Accessible accordion or list patterns for long quotes
	•	Spacing & typography for multi-block testimonials

—🪜 EXECUTION PLAN —
	1.	Analyze & Plan
	•	Locate and remove the <section> containing “User Reviews.”
	•	Identify where to inject the new “Leader Supports” markup.
	2.	Gather Resources
	•	Find Tailwind utilities for headings, lists, and quote styling.
	•	Review Alpine.js best-practices if any expand/collapse is needed.
	3.	Implement Iteratively
	•	Insert each endorsement as a styled <div> with <strong> for name/title and <p> for quote.
	•	Ensure proper spacing (mt-6, mb-4) and mobile readability.
	4.	Test & Validate
	•	Preview on mobile: confirm all names, titles, and quotes render exactly.
	•	Run Lighthouse and check accessibility for long text blocks.
	5.	Refine & Document
	•	Tweak typography or spacing if any block feels cramped.
	•	Update CHANGELOG.md under v0.2 with this endorsements overhaul.
