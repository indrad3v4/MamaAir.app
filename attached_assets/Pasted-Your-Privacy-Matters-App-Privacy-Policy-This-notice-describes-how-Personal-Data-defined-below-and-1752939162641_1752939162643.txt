At the end of the applicable Retention Period, we will remove your Personal Data from our databases and will require that our Business Partners remove any identifiable Personal Data from their databases. If there is any data that we are unable to delete entirely from our systems for technical reasons, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing of such data. Please note that once we disclose your Personal Data to third parties, we may not be able to access that Personal Data and we cannot force the deletion or modification of such information by third parties.

De-Identified Data: ‘Mama Air’ and its Business Partners reserve the right to continue using deidentified data indefinitely, even after Personal Data has been removed from ‘Mama Air’’s databases. We may continue to disclose de-identified data to third parties in a manner that does not reveal personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy. Our continued use of de-identified data will comport with applicable law.  

Personal Data from Minors
‘Mama Air’ does not knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18. Additionally, our Platform and Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 18 at this time. We request that these individuals not provide Personal Data to us.

Updating, Correcting, or Deleting Personal Data and User Accounts
You have the right to request restrictions on uses and disclosures of your Personal Data. While we are not required to agree to all restriction requests, we will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests when appropriate.

You may change your email address and other contact information by accessing your ‘Mama Air’ User Account. If you need to make changes or corrections to other information, you may contact us at support@mamaair.app. In order to comply with certain requests to limit use of your Personal Data, we may need to terminate your ability to access and/or use some or all of the Services.

Tracking

‍Cookie Policy
Cookies are small files that a web server sends to your computer or device when you visit a web application that uses cookies to keep track of your activity on that site. Cookies also exist within applications when a browser is needed to view or display certain content within the application. Cookies hold a small amount of data specific to a web application, which can later be used to help remember information you entered in the application (like your email or username), preferences selected, and movement within the application. We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information, and to facilitate efficient and secure access to the Services.  

Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Data. Further, we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with any other Personal Data to identify you. However, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your User Account (if one exists).

Opting Out of Cookies
If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and reject cookies. If you enable a do not track signal or otherwise configure your browsers to prevent us from collecting cookies, you will need to reenter your login information each time you visit the login page. You may also be unable to take advantage of some of the Services.‍

Do Not Track Disclosure
Some web browsers may transmit do not track (“DNT”) signals to websites with which the user communicates. To date, there is no industry standard for DNT and users cannot know how a given company responds to a DNT signal they receive from browsers. ‘Mama Air’ is committed to remaining apprised of DNT standards. However, ‘Mama Air’ does not support DNT browser settings and does not currently participate in any DNT frameworks that would allow ‘Mama Air’ to respond to signals or other mechanisms regarding the collection of your personal information.
