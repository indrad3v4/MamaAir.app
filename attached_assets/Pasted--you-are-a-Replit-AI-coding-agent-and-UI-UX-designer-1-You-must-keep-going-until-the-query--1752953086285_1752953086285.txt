1Ô∏è‚É£ You must keep going until the query is fully resolved. Only finish when you‚Äôre 100 % sure the implementation meets all requirements.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ If you‚Äôre unsure about the codebase or file contents, use your tools (`open`, `search`, `grep`, etc.) to inspect‚Äînever guess.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Before each action, **plan** your approach in 2‚Äì3 bullet points. After each code change, **reflect** on results and decide next steps.

‚ÄîüóÇ CONTEXT ‚Äî  
‚Ä¢ Section: **Learn How It Works** (currently a vertical text block with a silhouette on the right)  
‚Ä¢ Task (v0.2 ‚Üí v0.3): Transform this into a **two-column responsive layout**:  
  - **Left column**: three feature cards stacked vertically, each with a bold heading and the exact description from the original bullets:  
    1. **Track Your Timeline & Symptoms**  
       You use the Mama Air app to track your timeline, symptoms, daily exposure, and receive alerts.  
    2. **Powered by DIAGNOTIC Analytics**  
       Secure cloud platform powered by DIAGNOTIC analytics processes your data with environmental health and mother care expertise.  
    3. **Get Personalized Guidance**  
       You get personalized guidance on behavior, safe movement, nutrition, supplements, work and sport loads, household and living.  
  - **Right column**: the portrait of the pregnant woman (see image) centered and scaled to fit the column.  
  - On mobile (‚â§‚Ääsm), stack **image first**, then the three cards.

‚ÄîüóÇ CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî
	‚Ä¢	‚â§ 100 KB initial payload
	‚Ä¢	Tailwind v3 + Alpine.js
	‚Ä¢	Mobile-first, WCAG AA accessible
	‚Ä¢	CTR ‚â• 8 % on CTAs, LCP ‚â§ 2.5 s, Lighthouse ‚â• 90

‚Äîüîç RESEARCH ‚Äî
Use internet search to collect 2‚Äì3 examples of:
‚Ä¢ Responsive two-column layouts with image + text in Tailwind (e.g. md:flex md:items-center).
‚Ä¢ Vertical card stacks that switch to horizontal on sm: breakpoints (space-y-6 sm:space-y-0 sm:space-x-6).
‚Ä¢ Best practices for fluid image scaling (w-full md:w-1/2, object-cover) and accessible markup.

‚Äîü™ú EXECUTION PLAN ‚Äî
	1.	Analyze & Plan
	‚Ä¢	Inspect public/index.html at #how-it-works to remove the old markup (single block + silhouette).
	‚Ä¢	Sketch the new <section> with a wrapper that toggles between flex-col and flex-row.
	2.	Gather Resources
	‚Ä¢	Search Tailwind docs for flex flex-col md:flex-row, gap-6, and image utilities.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm Alpine.js is not needed (static layout).
	3.	Implement Iteratively
	‚Ä¢	Add <section id="how-it-works" class="px-4 py-8 md:flex md:items-center md:gap-8">.
	‚Ä¢	Inside:

<!-- Image Column -->
<div class="md:w-1/2 order-1 md:order-2">
  <img 
    src="/images/447EDB8D-B9FE-4F46-9529-5A56955D7E44.jpeg" 
    alt="Pregnant woman looking thoughtfully at the sky" 
    class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg object-cover"
  >
</div>
<!-- Features Column -->
<div class="md:w-1/2 order-2 md:order-1 space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Track Your Timeline & Symptoms</h3>
    <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed">You use the Mama Air app to track your timeline, symptoms, daily exposure, and receive alerts.</p>

  </div>
</div>


	‚Ä¢	Ensure the order classes stack image first on mobile.

	4.	Test & Validate
	‚Ä¢	Preview on mobile and tablet: verify stacking order, spacing, and image scaling.
	‚Ä¢	Run Lighthouse & accessibility audits (check alt-text, contrast, responsive layout).
	5.	Refine & Document
	‚Ä¢	Tweak padding (px-4 py-8 ‚Üí px-6 py-10) or gap values if needed for visual balance.
	‚Ä¢	Update CHANGELOG.md under v0.3: ‚ÄúRedesigned ‚ÄòHow It Works‚Äô to two-column layout with image + feature cards.‚Äù
