                                De-Identified Data: ‘Mama Air’ and its Business Partners reserve the right to continue using deidentified data indefinitely, even after Personal Data has been removed from ‘Mama Air’’s databases. We may continue to disclose de-identified data to third parties in a manner that does not reveal personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy. Our continued use of de-identified data will comport with applicable law.  

                                Personal Data from Minors
                                ‘Mama Air’ does not knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18. Additionally, our Platform and Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 18 at this time. We request that these individuals not provide Personal Data to us. If we learn that Personal Data from users under the age of 18 has been collected, we will deactivate the User Account associated with that data and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you are aware of a user under the age of 18 accessing the Services or Platform, please contact us at support@mamaair.app

                                • Access Personal Data held by ‘Mama Air’.  
                                • Erase/delete your Personal Data, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection and privacy laws and to the extent technologically feasible.  
                                • Receive communications related to the processing of your Personal Data.  
                                • Restrict the processing of your Personal Data to the extent permitted by law.  
                                • Object to the further processing of your Personal Data, including the right to object to marketing.  
                                • Request that your Personal Data be transferred to a third party, if possible.  
                                • Receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.  
                                • Rectify inaccurate personal information and, taking into account the purpose of processing the Personal Data, ensure it is complete.

                                Where the processing of your Personal Data by ‘Mama Air’ is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. If you would like to withdraw your consent or exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at support@mamaair.app

                                Updating, Correcting, or Deleting Personal Data and User Accounts
                                You have the right to request restrictions on uses and disclosures of your Personal Data. While we are not required to agree to all restriction requests, we will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests when appropriate.

                                You may change your email address and other contact information by accessing your ‘Mama Air’ User Account. If you need to make changes or corrections to other information, you may contact us at support@mamaair.app. In order to comply with certain requests to limit use of your Personal Data, we may need to terminate your ability to access and/or use some or all of the Services. BY REQUESTING TO LIMIT USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA OR DELETE PERSONAL DATA, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT 'Mama Air' WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CORRESPONDING LIMITATION IN THE SCOPE OF SERVICES OR TERMINATION OF SERVICES AS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH YOUR REQUEST.

                                You have the right to request deletion of any Personal Data from your User Account or the Platform. To request deletion of your Personal Data, please email us at support@mamaair.app and include a description of the Personal Data you would like removed. We will respond to all requests for data deletion as soon as reasonably possible.

                                Should you decide to delete your User Account entirely, you may do so through your ‘Mama Air’ User Account dashboard or by emailing support@mamaair.app. By terminating your User Account, you agree that you will not be able to access any information previously contained in your User Account. You further understand that it may not be technologically possible to remove all of your Personal Data from our systems. While we will use reasonable efforts to remove your Personal Data, the need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means a copy of your Personal Data may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate or remove.

                                Personal Data Security
                                ‘Mama Air’ understands the importance of data confidentiality and security. We use a combination of reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security controls to: (i) maintain the security and integrity of your Personal Data; (ii) protect against any threats or hazards to the security or integrity of your Personal Data; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information in our possession or control that could result in substantial harm to you.  

                                While ‘Mama Air’ uses reasonable security controls, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT SUCH TECHNIQUES WILL PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA. 'Mama Air' IS UNABLE TO GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OR INTEGRITY OF PERSONAL DATA TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDS. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT AND CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OR INTEGRITY OF ANY PERSONAL DATA YOU TRANSMIT TO US. YOU ASSUME THE RISK THAT UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY OR USE, HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE FAILURE, AND OTHER FACTORS MAY COMPROMISE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME.

                                Personal Data Safeguards
                                ‘Mama Air’ stores Personal Data on secured servers and uses a combination of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. Such safeguards include, but are not limited to, authentication, encryption, backups, and access controls.

                                User Protection of Personal Data
                                You are solely responsible for preventing unauthorized access to your devices and your User Account by protecting your account credentials and limiting access to your devices. ‘Mama Air’ has no access to or control over your device’s security settings, and it is your responsibility to implement any device-level security features and protections you feel are appropriate (e.g., password protection, encryption, remote wipe capability).

                                We recommend that you take all appropriate steps to secure any device that you use to access our Services and Platform.  Please note that ‘Mama Air’ will never send you an email requesting confidential information, such as account numbers, usernames, passwords, or Social Security Numbers. If you receive a suspicious email from 'Mama Air', please notify us at support@mamaair.app

                                Further, if you know of or suspect any unauthorized use or disclosure of your User Account information or any other security concern, please notify ‘Mama Air’ immediately.

                                Data and Security Breaches

In the event of a data or security breach, ‘Mama Air’ will take the following actions: (i) promptly investigate the security incident, validate the root cause, and, where applicable, remediate any vulnerabilities within ‘Mama Air’’s control which may have given rise to the security incident; (ii) comply with laws and regulations directly applicable to ‘Mama Air’ in connection with such security incident; (iii) as applicable, cooperate with any affected ‘Mama Air’ user or client in accordance with the terms of ‘Mama Air’’s contract with such user or client; and (iv) document and record actions taken by ‘Mama Air’ in connection with the security incident and conduct a postincident review of the circumstances related to the incident and actions/recommendations taken to prevent similar security incidents in the future. ‘Mama Air’ will notify you of any data or security breaches as required by and in accordance with applicable law.

                                Communications and Marketing

                                ‍‘Mama Air’ Communications - Advertising
                                ‘Mama Air’ may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing, or promotion materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any marketing or advertisement materials from ‘Mama Air’ at any time by following the unsubscribe link or by contacting us.

                                ‘Mama Air’ Communications - Non-Advertising
                                ‘Mama Air’ may send communications, including emails, to you regarding your User Account and the Services or Platform. You can choose to filter any User Account, Services, and Platform emails using your email settings, but we do not provide an option for you to opt out of these communications.

                                ‍Cookie Policy
                                Cookies are small files that a web server sends to your computer or device when you visit a web application that uses cookies to keep track of your activity on that site. Cookies also exist within applications when a browser is needed to view or display certain content within the application. Cookies hold a small amount of data specific to a web application, which can later be used to help remember information you entered in the application (like your email or username), preferences selected, and movement within the application. We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information, and to facilitate efficient and secure access to the Services.  

                                Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Data. Further, we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with any other Personal Data to identify you. However, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your User Account (if one exists).

                                Opting Out of Cookies
                                If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and reject cookies. If you enable a do not track signal or otherwise configure your browsers to prevent us from collecting cookies, you will need to reenter your login information each time you visit the login page. You may also be unable to take advantage of some of the Services.‍

                                Do Not Track Disclosure
                                Some web browsers may transmit do not track (“DNT”) signals to websites with which the user communicates. To date, there is no industry standard for DNT and users cannot know how a given company responds to a DNT signal they receive from browsers. ‘Mama Air’ is committed to remaining apprised of DNT standards. However, ‘Mama Air’ does not support DNT browser settings and does not currently participate in any DNT frameworks that would allow ‘Mama Air’ to respond to signals or other mechanisms regarding the collection of your personal information.
